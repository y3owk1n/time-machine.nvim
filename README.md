## üì¶ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
-- time-machine.lua
return {
 "y3owk1n/time-machine.nvim",
 version = "*", -- remove this if you want to use the `main` branch
 opts = {
  -- your configuration comes here
  -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
  -- refer to the configuration section below
 }
}
```

If you are using other package managers you need to call `setup`:

```lua
require("dotmd").setup({
  -- your configuration
})
```

- The following diff CLI is optional to be installed in your $PATH:
  - `difft`
  - `diff`

 },
 diff_tool = "native",
 native_diff_opts = {
  result_type = "unified",
  ctxlen = 3,
  algorithm = "histogram",
