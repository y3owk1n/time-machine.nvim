## üì¶ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
-- time-machine.lua
return {
 "y3owk1n/time-machine.nvim",
 version = "*", -- remove this if you want to use the `main` branch
 opts = {
  -- your configuration comes here
  -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
  -- refer to the configuration section below
 }
}
```

If you are using other package managers you need to call `setup`:

```lua
require("time-machine").setup({
  -- your configuration
})
```

### Requirements

- Neovim 0.11+ with Lua support
- Optional diff utilities in your $PATH:
  - `difft` for syntax-aware diffs
  - Standard `diff` utility
- Recommended Neovim settings:

```lua
vim.opt.undofile = true                      -- Enable persistent undo
vim.opt.undodir = vim.fn.expand("~/.undodir") -- Set custom undo directory
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

> [!important]
> Make sure to run `:checkhealth time-machine` if something isn't working properly.

**time-machine.nvim** is highly configurable. And the default configurations are as below.

### Default Options

```lua
---@alias TimeMachine.DiffTool "native"|"difft"|"diff"
---@alias TimeMachine.SplitDirection 'left'|'right'

---@class TimeMachine.Config
---@field diff_tool? TimeMachine.DiffTool The diff tool to use
---@field native_diff_opts? vim.diff.Opts The options for vim.diff
---@field ignore_filesize? integer|nil The file size to ignore undo saved to disk
---@field ignored_filetypes? string[] The file types to ignore undo saved to disk
---@field split_opts? TimeMachine.Config.SplitOpts The split options
---@field float_opts? TimeMachine.Config.FloatOpts The floating window options
---@field keymaps? TimeMachine.Config.Keymaps The keymaps for actions

---@class TimeMachine.Config.Keymaps
---@field undo? string The keymap to undo
---@field redo? string The keymap to redo
---@field restore_undopoint? string The keymap to restore the undopoint
---@field refresh_timeline? string The keymap to refresh the timeline
---@field preview_sequence_diff? string The keymap to preview the sequence diff
---@field tag_sequence? string The keymap to tag the sequence
---@field close? string The keymap to close the timeline
---@field help? string The keymap to show the help
---@field toggle_current_timeline? string The keymap to toggle to only show the current timeline

---@class TimeMachine.Config.SplitOpts
---@field split? TimeMachine.SplitDirection The split direction
---@field width? integer The width of the split

---@class TimeMachine.Config.FloatOpts
---@field width? integer The width of the window
---@field height? integer The height of the window
```

```lua
---@type TimeMachine.Config
{
 split_opts = {
  split = "left", -- where to open the tree panel
  width = 50, -- columns number
 },
 float_opts = {
  width = 0.8, -- between 0 and 1
  height = 0.8, -- between 0 and 1
 },
 diff_tool = "native", -- default diff engine
 native_diff_opts = {
  result_type = "unified",
  ctxlen = 3,
  algorithm = "histogram",
 },
 keymaps = {
  undo = "u",
  redo = "<C-r>",
  restore_undopoint = "<CR>",
  refresh_timeline = "r",
  preview_sequence_diff = "p",
  tag_sequence = "t",
  close = "q",
  help = "g?",
  toggle_current_timeline = "c",
 },
 ignore_filesize = nil, -- e.g. 10 * 1024 * 1024
 ignored_filetypes = {
  "terminal",
  "nofile",
  "time-machine-list",
  "mason",
  "snacks_picker_list",
  "snacks_picker_input",
  "snacks_dashboard",
  "snacks_notif_history",
  "lazy",
 },
}
```

> [!note]
> `ignored_filesize` and `ignored_filetypes` are does not disable undo, it only prevent the undo to save to the undofile. You don't have to set them if you don't want to.

## üöÄ Quick Start

See the example below for how to configure **time-machine.nvim**.

```lua
{
 "y3owk1n/time-machine.nvim",
 event = { "VeryLazy" },
 ---@type TimeMachine.Config
 opts = {},
 keys = {
  {
   "<leader>t",
   "",
   desc = "Time Machine",
  },
  {
   "<leader>tt",
   function()
    require("time-machine").actions.toggle()
   end,
   mode = "n",
   desc = "[Time Machine] Toggle Tree",
  },
  {
   "<leader>tx",
   function()
    require("time-machine").actions.purge_current()
   end,
   mode = "n",
   desc = "[Time Machine] Purge current",
  },
  {
   "<leader>tX",
   function()
    require("time-machine").actions.purge_all()
   end,
   mode = "n",
   desc = "[Time Machine] Purge all",
  },
 },
},
```

## üåé API

**time-machine.nvim** provides the following api functions that you can use to map to your own keybindings:

### Toggle the tree

Toggle the undotree based on current buffer.

```lua
---@param force? boolean Whether to force the purge
require("time-machine").purge_buffer(force)
```

### Purge all undofiles

Purge all undofiles (including tagfiles).

```lua
---@param force? boolean Whether to force the purge
require("time-machine").purge_all(force)
```
